Review the performance of discounts offered to customers 60 years old and over, analyzing trends to identify the causes behind the increasing total discount each month. This data-driven approach informs decisions on how to boost sales while maintaining profitability and managing the rising costs of discounts.
Tableau dashboards and story designed for a short presentation to our Board of Directors.

The reports generated by the back-end of our POS system don't provide the information I was looking for, so I connected directly to our transaction journal database in SQLAnywhere 17 using an ODBC Connection.

Unfortunately, ECRS doesn't provide the schema for the very complex database with over 50 tables and views, so I had to figure it out on my own, which was pretty time consuming but interesting to do.

The easiest way to get the data out was using a pyodbc.connect() connection, SQLAnywhere doesn't support SQL Alchemy so I had to send the queries instead using pd.read_sql().

After gathering all the transactions, I used the second notebook to cleanup and prepare the data to be imported into Tableau for visualization.
